# React-GitHub

GitHub repos based on popularity

## Directions

- You may use any 3rd party libraries you know well that seems like a fit for the scenario.
- List the libraries in the README and a short description about why you chose each one.
- If interaction details are missing, use your best judgment and make a note to explain it during the follow-up.
- Download zip file and upload to Google Drive, email link back to the recruiter.

## Getting Started

In order to run the application run the following commands in a terminal.

- `yarn start`
- The app will be available on http://localhost:3000/

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Code the UI mockups below using the frontend technologies of your choice (We use React stack)
- [ ] Use Github open API to display the data
  - https://api.github.com/users/octocat
  - https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos
- [ ] Overview view > Display most popular repository cards ordered by most starred.
- [ ] Repositories view > display all repositories ordered by the latest update.
- [ ] Repositories view > Enable user to filter/search in the repository list

### Bonus Points

- [ ] Lazy load repositories view
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Flair & Features?

## Libraries Used

- `react` - my front-end framework of choice for performance and ease of use.
- `create-react-app` - ability to get up and running quickly

# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
